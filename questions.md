A1 : **the brown bag session** means the discussion (of whatever type) will occur over lunch. People used to carry their lunch in a 
brown paper bag (historical - this usually meant a *sandwich plus a drink, dessert*, etc.). So a brown bag session means to bring your 
lunch and drink, plan on eating and drinking while the topic is covered. The sessions can be structured or unstructured and are often used to transfer knowledge, solve problems, brainstorm, and 
build trust among attendees. Brown bag meetings promote teamwork, reinforce company values and missions, and increase employee morale.
